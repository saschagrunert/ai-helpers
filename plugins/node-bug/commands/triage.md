## Name
node-bug:triage

## Synopsis
```text
/node-bug:triage [--sub-team core] [--sprint "OCP Node Core Sprint 42"] [--unassigned-only] [--notify-slack]
```

## Description

Queries all open bugs in OCPBUGS for Node team components using the "Node Bugs" saved filter, classifies them into triage buckets (Release Blockers, Customer Escalations, Potential Blockers, Component Regressions, Untriaged), routes each bug to the correct sub-team, and suggests assignments based on current workload. Optionally sends a triage summary to Slack.

Designed for both interactive triage sessions and headless execution via `claude --print`.

## Implementation

### Phase 0: Setup and Argument Parsing

1. **Parse Arguments**
   - `--sub-team core|dra`: Filter results to one sub-team's components. Optional. Read the DRA/Devices component list from the sub-teams table in [shared/components.md](../../node-team/skills/node/references/shared/components.md) rather than hardcoding names.
     - `core`: all Node components not in the DRA/Devices sub-team
     - `dra`: components listed under DRA/Devices in the sub-teams table
   - `--sprint <name>`: Filter to bugs in a specific sprint (e.g., "OCP Node Core Sprint 42"). Optional.
   - `--unassigned-only`: Show only untriaged or unassigned bugs. Optional.
   - `--notify-slack`: Send triage summary to Slack. Requires either `$SLACK_API_TOKEN` + `$SLACK_CHANNEL` (enables threading) or `$SLACK_WEBHOOK` (no threading). Optional.

2. **Validate Jira Credentials**

   Use the authentication chain from the [jira reference](../../node-team/skills/node/references/jira.md):

   ```bash
   JIRA_API_TOKEN="${JIRA_API_TOKEN:-$(security find-generic-password -s "JIRA_API_TOKEN" -w 2>/dev/null || secret-tool lookup service redhat key JIRA_API_TOKEN 2>/dev/null)}"
   JIRA_USER="${JIRA_EMAIL:-$(security find-generic-password -s "JIRA_API_TOKEN" -g 2>&1 | grep acct | sed 's/.*="//;s/"//')}"
   [[ "$JIRA_USER" != *@* ]] && JIRA_USER="${JIRA_USER}@redhat.com"
   : "${JIRA_USER:=$(git config user.email)}"
   ```

   Exit with error if `JIRA_API_TOKEN` is empty after the chain.

3. **If `--notify-slack`**, verify Slack credentials. Either `$SLACK_API_TOKEN` + `$SLACK_CHANNEL` (preferred) or `$SLACK_WEBHOOK`. Exit with error if neither is configured. Default `$SLACK_CHANNEL` to `GK6BJJ1J5` (`#team-node`) if not set.

4. **Create work directory**: `mkdir -p .work/node-bug/triage-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`

---

### Phase 1: Query Bugs

1. **Use the Jira saved filter** "Node Bugs" (ID 83963) for the base query. The filter defines which components are in scope.

2. **Build JQL**:

   ```text
   filter = "Node Bugs" AND status not in (Closed, Done, Verified)
   ```

   Apply optional filters (read DRA/Devices component names from the sub-teams table in [shared/components.md](../../node-team/skills/node/references/shared/components.md)):
   - If `--sub-team dra`: append `AND component in (<DRA/Devices components>)`
   - If `--sub-team core`: append `AND component not in (<DRA/Devices components>)`
   - If `--sprint <name>`: append `AND sprint = "<name>"`
   - If `--unassigned-only`: append `AND (assignee is EMPTY OR assignee in ("aos-node@redhat.com") OR priority = Undefined)`

3. **Execute the query** using the POST search endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -s -u "$JIRA_USER:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST "https://redhat.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/search/jql" \
     -d '{
       "jql": "<constructed JQL>",
       "maxResults": 100,
       "fields": [
         "key", "summary", "status", "priority", "assignee",
         "components", "labels",
         "customfield_10840",
         "customfield_10847",
         "customfield_10978",
         "customfield_10020"
       ]
     }'
   ```

   Custom field mapping:
   - `customfield_10840`: Severity
   - `customfield_10847`: Release Blocker
   - `customfield_10978`: SFDC Cases Counter
   - `customfield_10020`: Sprint

   Handle pagination if `total` exceeds `maxResults` by issuing additional requests with `startAt`.

4. **Print intermediate summary**: "Found N open bugs for Node team components."

**Decision Point:**
- IF 0 bugs found: print "No open bugs matching filters." and exit.
- IF bugs found: continue to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Classify and Route

1. **Route each bug to its sub-team** using the sub-teams table from [shared/components.md](../../node-team/skills/node/references/shared/components.md):
   - DRA/Devices: bugs whose component appears in the DRA/Devices row of the sub-teams table
   - Core: all other Node components

2. **Classify each bug into triage buckets** using the [Bug Triage Definitions](../../node-team/skills/node/references/jira.md):

   - **Release Blockers**: `"Release Blocker"` field value is "Approved"
   - **Potential Blockers**: priority is "Blocker" AND `"Release Blocker"` is empty (Blocker priority set but no release blocker decision yet)
   - **Customer Escalations**: `customfield_10978` (SFDC Cases Counter) is not null/empty. To also catch bugs marked only via Customer Impact (no SFDC case linked), run a supplementary JQL query: `filter = "Node Bugs" AND "Customer Impact" = "Customer Escalated" AND "SFDC Cases Counter" is EMPTY` and merge the results. The Customer Impact custom field ID is not documented, so JQL is the only way to check it.
   - **Component Regressions**: labels contain `component-regression`
   - **Untriaged**: priority is "Undefined", OR `"Release Blocker"` is "Proposed", OR assignee is `aos-node@redhat.com`
   - **Other**: all remaining bugs

   A bug can appear in multiple buckets (e.g., a release blocker that is also a customer escalation). Count it in each applicable bucket.

3. **Assignment suggestions** (when team roster files exist):

   Load team rosters from `~/.node-assistant/team-roster-core.json` and `~/.node-assistant/team-roster-dra.json`. If the files do not exist, skip assignment suggestions and print "Roster files not found, skipping assignment suggestions."

   Query all team members' open bug counts in a single call:
   ```text
   filter = "Node Bugs" AND status not in (Closed, Done, Verified) AND assignee in (<all roster members>)
   ```
   Group results by assignee in code to build a workload map.

   For each unassigned or mailing-list-assigned bug:
   - Determine the correct sub-team from step 1
   - Exclude "Node Team Bot Account" from suggestions
   - Suggest the team member with the fewest open bugs from the appropriate sub-team roster

---

### Phase 3: Generate Triage Summary

1. **Print the triage summary** grouped by classification with counts:

   ```text
   Node Bug Triage (N bugs)

   Release Blockers: X
   Customer Escalations: X
   Potential Blockers: X
   Component Regressions: X
   Untriaged: X
   Other: X

   --- Release Blockers ---
   * OCPBUGS-XXXXX: <summary> (Component, Severity, Assignee)
   * OCPBUGS-XXXXX: <summary> (Component, Severity, Unassigned -> suggested: <name>)

   --- Customer Escalations ---
   * OCPBUGS-XXXXX: <summary> (Component, N support cases, Assignee)

   --- Potential Blockers ---
   * OCPBUGS-XXXXX: <summary> (Component, Severity, Assignee)

   --- Component Regressions ---
   * OCPBUGS-XXXXX: <summary> (Component, Assignee)

   --- Untriaged ---
   * OCPBUGS-XXXXX: <summary> (Component, Unassigned -> suggested: <name>)

   --- Other ---
   * OCPBUGS-XXXXX: <summary> (Component, Priority, Assignee)

   Workload Distribution:
   | Team Member | Open Bugs | Sub-team |
   |-------------|-----------|----------|
   | <name>      | N         | Core     |
   | <name>      | N         | DRA      |

   Filter: https://redhat.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=83963
   Dashboard: https://redhat.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/12991
   ```

   Omit empty sections. Include the workload distribution table only when roster files are available. Show assignment suggestions inline for unassigned bugs.

2. **Save the report** to `.work/node-bug/triage-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/report.md`.

3. **If `--notify-slack`**: Post the summary to Slack.

   With `$SLACK_API_TOKEN` + `$SLACK_CHANNEL`:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"channel":"'"$SLACK_CHANNEL"'","text":"<summary text>","unfurl_links":false}'
   ```

   With `$SLACK_WEBHOOK` (fallback, no threading):
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$SLACK_WEBHOOK" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text":"<summary text>"}'
   ```

   Include the Jira filter and dashboard links at the end:
   - Filter: `https://redhat.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=83963`
   - Dashboard: `https://redhat.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/12991`

## Return Value

Prints the triage summary to stdout. Saves a report file to `.work/node-bug/triage-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/report.md`. If `--notify-slack` is specified, posts the summary to Slack. No write operations are performed on Jira (read-only).

## Examples

1. **Full triage across all sub-teams**:
   ```text
   /node-bug:triage
   ```

2. **Core sub-team bugs in the current sprint**:
   ```text
   /node-bug:triage --sub-team core --sprint "OCP Node Core Sprint 42"
   ```

3. **Unassigned DRA/Devices bugs only**:
   ```text
   /node-bug:triage --sub-team dra --unassigned-only
   ```

4. **Triage with Slack notification**:
   ```text
   /node-bug:triage --notify-slack
   ```

5. **Headless run for CI/scheduled jobs**:
   ```bash
   claude --print "/node-bug:triage --unassigned-only --notify-slack"
   ```

## Arguments

- `--sub-team core|dra`: Filter to one sub-team's components. `core` includes all Node components not in the DRA/Devices sub-team. `dra` includes only components listed under DRA/Devices in the [sub-teams table](../../node-team/skills/node/references/shared/components.md). Optional.
- `--sprint <name>`: Filter to bugs in a specific sprint. Use the exact sprint name from Jira (e.g., "OCP Node Core Sprint 42"). Optional.
- `--unassigned-only`: Show only bugs that are untriaged or unassigned (priority Undefined, assignee is the mailing list, or assignee is empty). Optional.
- `--notify-slack`: Send the triage summary to Slack. Requires either `$SLACK_API_TOKEN` + `$SLACK_CHANNEL` (preferred, enables threaded messages) or `$SLACK_WEBHOOK` (simpler, no threading). Default `$SLACK_CHANNEL`: `GK6BJJ1J5` (`#team-node`). Optional.

## Notes

- The Jira query uses the "Node Bugs" saved filter (ID 83963) as the base. This filter is maintained in Jira and defines which bugs are in scope. The "Node Bugs" dashboard (ID 12991) provides a visual overview at `https://redhat.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/12991`.
- Sub-team routing uses the sub-teams table from the [node-team shared components reference](../../node-team/skills/node/references/shared/components.md). Core owns all Node components not listed under DRA/Devices.
- Assignment suggestions require team roster files at `~/.node-assistant/team-roster-{core,dra}.json`. Sync these from Jira config issue OCPNODE-4230 (see [jira.md](../../node-team/skills/node/references/jira.md) Team Roster section).
- The command is read-only. It does not modify bugs, change assignments, or transition issues. All suggestions are advisory.
- Reports and artifacts are saved to `.work/node-bug/` (gitignored).
- For CVE-specific triage with reachability analysis, use `/node-cve:triage` instead.
