# Node Onboarding Plugin

Interactive onboarding for new OpenShift Node team members. Replaces the
manual Google Doc walkthrough with a guided checklist that validates access,
tracks progress, and provides step-by-step instructions.

Part of the [node-team plugin family](../node-team/).

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install node-onboarding@ai-helpers
```

Requires the `node-team` plugin (installed automatically as a dependency).

## Commands

### `node-onboarding:checklist`

Interactive onboarding workflow that guides through access setup, tool
installation, and environment configuration. Supports dev and QE tracks.

```bash
# Start onboarding (dev track, default)
/node-onboarding:checklist

# QE-specific onboarding
/node-onboarding:checklist --track qe

# Resume from where you left off
/node-onboarding:checklist --resume

# Run automated checks only (no prompts)
/node-onboarding:checklist --check-only
```
